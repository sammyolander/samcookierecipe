<h2>Directions</h2>
</u>
  <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
  <p>Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt, and rolled oats. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine butter, light brown sugar, and superfine sugar. Beat until creamy. Add egg and vanilla, and beat again until smooth.</p>

  <h3>Step 2: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
  <p>Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat until smooth. By hand, fold in chopped pecans and M&M's.</p>

  <h3>Step 3: Shape the Cookies</h3>
  <p>Roll quarter-cup measures of dough into balls and flatten them into fat disks (about ½ inch thick). Place on a parchment-lined or greased baking sheet, about 6 at a time, so they have room to spread.</p>

  <h3>Step 4: Bake and Cool</h3>
  <p>Bake until cookies are risen, dry on the surface, and very lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. They will be too soft to lift from the baking sheet. Set aside to harden for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool.</p>
